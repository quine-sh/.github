Quira is an _**operating system for OSS organisations**_ and a _**monetisation platform for software creators**_. In other words, Quira helps OSS communities grow by broadcasting contribution opportunities to developers worldwide.

Quira's mission is to expand the GDP of software creators and help them derive value from their time and skills in an LLM-driven world. To achieve this, we're designing sustainable monetisation experiences that enable developers to build both their expertise and reputation in the open.

We're rapidly approaching a world with **1 billion developers**. Quira is building the economic infrastructure to support software-related work and education in this new era.
